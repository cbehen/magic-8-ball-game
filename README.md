# magic-8-ball-game

Runs a game of magic 8 ball. Welcomes the user to the game and prompts them to answer their yes-or-no question. Checks to make sure the question has a question mark. If not, they are asked to re-enter their question. Selects a response randomly from the list. Asks the player if they would like to ask another question or not. If they respond with "yes", the program will run again. If they respond with "no", the game will end.
